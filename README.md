# strong_password_generator
A simple (but complete and fully customizable) program in python to generate cryptographically secure passwords. It generates 6 differents passwords, so you can pick the best that fits
your needs.

The use is, I think, pretty intuitive. The settings editing is explained in detail.

Should you have any question, suggestion, problem, feel free to contact me to lcram33@pm.me or on discord (Lcram33#7313).
